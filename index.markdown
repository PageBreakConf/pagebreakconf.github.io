<h3>Single-Source Publishing and AI</h3>

<p>AI is the question in everyone's minds these days: how can it be used within the publishing ecosystem? Where will the disruptions happen, and what are the ethics surrounding it?</p>

<p>"Single-source publishing" means centralizing your content and editing in a primary text file, and then generating all your required output formats from that primary source of truth. (For more background, here are <a href="https://www.robotscooking.com/single-source-publishing/" target="_blank">a couple</a> of <a href="https://medium.com/hederis-app/automated-publishing-workflows-explained-58c5da5fb3fe" target="_blank">posts</a> from our organizers.) One of the most common pieces of feedback that comes up in any discussion of single-source publishing is: how can my organization implement this?</p>

<p>PageBreak brings together a deep network of thought-leaders to present background, roadmaps, and case studies on these topics and many more. Need to learn more before our next event?
