<h3>2023: Single-Source Publishing and AI</h3>

<p>Our focus for 2023 is on single-source pubslishing and AI. "Single-source publishing" means centralizing your content and editing in a primary text file, and then generating all your required output formats from that primary source of truth. (For more background, here are <a href="https://www.robotscooking.com/single-source-publishing/" target="_blank">a couple</a> of <a href="https://medium.com/hederis-app/automated-publishing-workflows-explained-58c5da5fb3fe" target="_blank">posts</a> from our organizers.) One of the most common pieces of feedback that comes up in any discussion of single-source publishing is: how can my organization implement this? <span class="highlight">At this year's conference, we'll provide practical sessions and workshops to help you understand the requirements of single-source workflows and how you can implement them at your organization.</span> AI adds extra power and complexity to the single-source publishing landscape, and we'll address how it can be incorporated into your workflows.</p>
