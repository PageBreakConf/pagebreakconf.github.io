<h2>Explore what publishing is and can be</h2>
<p>Building on the best of Books in Browsers and Tools of Change, PageBreak is a community-driven conference focused on sharing the ways that the publishing industry is moving beyond traditional models and embracing emergent technologies, workflows, and processes.</p>

<p>We seek to foster a community of people who are excited about building change together, and willing to try new things.</p>

<p>Whether you're an industry veteran thinking about the future of publishing, an entrepreneur launching your own publishing-related business, a student of publishing and media, or anyone with curiosity, vision, and interest in learning about new ways of interacting on the web, you are welcome at PageBreak 2022.</p>

<p>The two-day in-person event will feature engaging talks and panels, with ample opportunities to network, brainstorm, and socialize in an "unconference" style. </p>

<p>PageBreak is fundamentally focused on sharing our visions for the future, and discussing whatâ€™s needed to get us there.</p>
